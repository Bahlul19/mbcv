                        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p><b>Janssen-Cilag Limited</b> cares about your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we or our service providers collect through the website or application (hereinafter the “<b>Service</b>”) operated and controlled by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy. By providing personal information to us or by using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>USE BY MINORS</h3>

<p>The Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we request that these individuals not provide personal information through the Service. If your child has submitted Personal Information and you would like to request that such Personal Information be removed, please contact us as explained below under Contacting Us.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>

<p>We may ask you to submit personal information in order for you to benefit from certain features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, or order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be informed what information is required and what information is optional.</p>

<p>We may combine the information you submit with other information we have collected from you, whether on  or offline, including, for example, your purchase history.  We may also combine it with information we receive about you from other Johnson & Johnson affiliates.</p>

<p>If you submit any personal information relating to another individual to us, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>SENSITIVE INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Unless we specifically request or invite it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., Social Security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, health or medical conditions, sex life or sexual orientation, criminal background, or trade union membership, or biometric or genetic data) on or through the Service or otherwise to us.</p>

<h3>AUTOMATIC INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h3>

<p>We and our service providers may collect certain information automatically as you navigate around the Service.  Please read the <a href="/mbcv-cookie-policy.html" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a> for detailed information about the cookies and other tracking technologies used on the Service.  Except where allowed by applicable law, we place cookies after having received your consent through the cookie banner or preference center. The Cookie Policy includes information on how you may disable these technologies.</p>

<p>We and our service providers may also automatically collect and use information in the following ways:</p>

<p><b>Through your browser:</b> Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, and Internet browser type and version.  We may collect similar information, such as your device type and identifier, if you access the Service through a mobile device.  We use this information to ensure that the Service functions properly.</p>

<p><b>IP address:</b> Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Service, along with the time of the visit and the pages visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many online services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Service usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the Service.  We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</p>

<p><b>Device Information:</b> We may collect information about your mobile device, such as a unique device identifier, to understand how you use the Service.</p>

Please note that if you opt out as described above, we will not be able to remove your personal information from the databases of our affiliates with which we have already shared your information (i.e., as of the date that we implement your opt-out request). Please also note that if you opt out of receiving marketing-related messages from us, we may still send you important transactional and administrative messages, from which you cannot opt out.</p>

<p><b>How you can access, change, or delete your personal information</b></p>

<p>If you would like to review, correct, update, restrict, or delete your personal information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent these rights are provided to you by applicable law), please contact us via <a href="mailto:emailpermission@its.jnj.com" target="_blank">emailpermission@its.jnj.com</a>.

<h3>CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER</h3>

<p>Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or service providers, and by using our Service or by providing consent to us (where required by law), your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including to the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country. Appropriate contractual and other measures are in place to protect personal information when it is transferred to our affiliates or third parties in other countries.</p>

<p>Some non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en?elqTrackId=847c9cf3b3724753b7cab5123bba4b73" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofererer">here</a>.

You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting our data protection officer in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.</p>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>

<p>We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures designed to protect personal information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.</p>

<h3>RETENTION PERIOD</h3>

<p>We will retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained.  The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:  (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Service to you; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).</p>
